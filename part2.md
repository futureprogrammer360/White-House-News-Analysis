# White House News Analysis Project Part 2

## Data Science

In part 1 of this tutorial, you used `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape the White House website and extract useful data from its news page. Now that we have the data, let's analyze it.

### Data Analysis and `pandas`

Last time, our web scraping program dumped the data it collected in a CSV (comma-separated values) file, which stores data in rows and columns, similar to Excel or Google Sheets.

The Python package `pandas` is a foundation library in data science, providing us with powerful data structures like `DataFrame` for easy data manipulation and storing. Here's the installation command:

```
pip install pandas
```

### `Matplotlib` and data visualization

Data scientists use graphs and charts to visualize big datasets. The Python library `Matplotlib` is used for this exact purpose, allowing us to create line plots, scatter plots, histograms, pie charts, and more. This is the installation command:

```
pip install matplotlib
```

### Using `wordcloud` to create word clouds

An elegant way to visualize textual data is word clouds, images generated from words. The Python package `wordcloud` can create such images for us.

```
pip install wordcloud
```
